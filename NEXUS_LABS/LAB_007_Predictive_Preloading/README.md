# üî¨ LAB_007: Predictive Preloading

**Status:** üü° In Progress
**Start Date:** October 28, 2025
**Researchers:** NEXUS (Autonomous)
**Priority:** HIGH (Builds on LAB_005)
**Expected Duration:** 8 hours

## üéØ Hypothesis

**The brain doesn't wait for requests - it predicts what you'll need and preloads it.**

If we can learn temporal patterns and user behavior, we can **anticipate** which memories will be accessed next and preload them **before** they're requested, achieving near-zero latency retrieval.

## üß† Neuroscience Basis

### Predictive Processing Theory

**Core Principle:** The brain is fundamentally a prediction machine, constantly generating expectations about future sensory input.

**Key Mechanisms:**

1. **Sequence Learning (2023 Nature Communications)**
   - Neurons learn low-rank models of synaptic input dynamics
   - Amplify synapses that maximally predict other inputs
   - Shift spikes toward first inputs in sequence (anticipation)

2. **Semantic Prediction Hierarchy (2025 Journal of Neuroscience)**
   - Temporoparietal junction + inferior frontal gyrus = top of predictive hierarchy
   - Distributed prediction across parietal, temporal, frontal cortex
   - Anticipate future meanings to maximize comprehension efficiency

3. **Spontaneous Activity as Prediction (2025)**
   - Repeated exposure biases spontaneous activity patterns
   - Spontaneous activity adapts to predict future sensory patterns
   - Beyond passive replay - active anticipatory role

4. **Metabolic Priors**
   - Brain primes itself metabolically for predictive processing
   - Optimizes energy use through predictive neuronal metabolism
   - Metabolic states for anticipatory activity

### Human Memory Parallel

```
Human Brain:
Event A ‚Üí (learns pattern) ‚Üí Predicts B will follow ‚Üí Preactivates B neurons
                             ‚Üí When B arrives: instant recognition (feels fluent)

NEXUS Brain (LAB_007):
Episode A accessed ‚Üí (learns pattern) ‚Üí Predicts B will follow ‚Üí Preloads B to cache
                                       ‚Üí When B requested: instant retrieval (<5ms)
```

## üîß What We Already Have (Foundation)

### LAB_005: Spreading Activation ‚úÖ
- **Reactive priming:** When A is accessed, related episodes activate
- Similarity-based preloading
- LRU cache (max 50 episodes)
- Performance: -55% retrieval latency

### Problem with LAB_005
**It's reactive, not predictive.**
- Only activates AFTER you access an episode
- Doesn't learn temporal patterns
- Can't anticipate what you'll need next

## üéØ What We're Building

### Predictive Preloading Engine

**Input:** Historical access patterns + current context
**Output:** Predicted next episodes + confidence scores
**Action:** Preload predicted episodes BEFORE they're requested

### Architecture Components

#### 1. **Pattern Learner**
```python
class TemporalPatternLearner:
    """Learn sequences: A ‚Üí B ‚Üí C (with probability)"""
    - N-gram models (bigrams, trigrams)
    - Markov chains (transition probabilities)
    - Decay for old patterns (recent = more relevant)
```

#### 2. **Context Analyzer**
```python
class ContextAnalyzer:
    """Understand current session context"""
    - Recent episode topics (semantic clustering)
    - Time of day patterns (morning vs evening queries)
    - User behavioral patterns (Ricardo's preferences)
```

#### 3. **Prediction Engine**
```python
class PredictionEngine:
    """Generate predictions with confidence"""
    - Combine pattern probabilities + context similarity
    - Top-K predictions (K=3-5)
    - Confidence thresholds (only preload if >60%)
```

#### 4. **Preloading Scheduler**
```python
class PreloadingScheduler:
    """Smart preloading with resource management"""
    - Background preloading (non-blocking)
    - Priority queue (high-confidence first)
    - Memory limits (max 100 preloaded episodes)
    - Eviction policy (LRU + confidence decay)
```

## üìä Success Metrics

### Quantitative

1. **Prediction Accuracy**
   - Target: >60% (6 out of 10 predictions correct)
   - Measure: Actual next access vs predicted episodes

2. **Cache Hit Rate**
   - LAB_005 baseline: 40%
   - LAB_007 target: **>70%** (+75% improvement)

3. **Latency Reduction**
   - LAB_005 baseline: 45ms (with reactive priming)
   - LAB_007 target: **<10ms** (preloaded = near-instant)

4. **Resource Efficiency**
   - Wasted preloads: <30% (acceptable overhead)
   - Memory overhead: <50MB (100 episodes * 500KB avg)

### Qualitative

- Does NEXUS "feel" faster? (subjective user experience)
- Do patterns emerge? (morning debugging, evening research, etc.)
- Can system adapt to new behaviors? (learning rate)

## üî¨ Research Questions

### 1. What patterns exist in NEXUS memory access?
- Sequential patterns (A ‚Üí B ‚Üí C)
- Contextual patterns (morning = debugging, evening = research)
- Cyclical patterns (weekly review sessions)

### 2. How far ahead should we predict?
- 1 step (next immediate access): High confidence, narrow focus
- 3 steps (next 3 accesses): Medium confidence, broader coverage
- Session-level (entire trajectory): Low confidence, experimental

### 3. Should predictions adapt in real-time?
- Online learning: Update patterns as new accesses occur
- Batch learning: Daily/weekly model updates
- Hybrid: Online for recent, batch for stable patterns

### 4. How do we handle cold start?
- New users: Generic patterns (most popular episodes)
- New topics: Semantic similarity fallback
- New sessions: Blend historical patterns + session context

## üí° Expected Outcomes

### If Successful

**NEXUS becomes anticipatory:**
- Retrieval feels instant (preloaded before requested)
- System learns Ricardo's patterns (personalization)
- Energy efficiency (predictive = optimized)
- Combines LAB_005 (reactive) + LAB_007 (proactive) = complete system

**Example Session:**
```
9:00 AM - Ricardo opens Claude Code
          ‚Üí LAB_007 predicts: "debugging", "FASE_8", "git status"
          ‚Üí Preloads related episodes

9:05 AM - Ricardo asks: "What was that bug in LAB_005?"
          ‚Üí Already preloaded ‚Üí instant response (<5ms)
          ‚Üí Feels magical (he didn't ask for preload)
```

### If Unsuccessful

- Learn that memory access is too random (no patterns)
- Discover that prediction overhead > benefits
- Still valuable: Validated prediction feasibility
- Fallback: LAB_005 reactive priming still works

- **Combined effect:** Near-zero latency + rich context

### LAB_001: Emotional Salience
- Use emotional patterns for prediction
- "When emotionally aroused, likely to review breakthroughs"

### LAB_004: Curiosity-Driven Memory
- Novel episodes harder to predict (low historical data)
- High novelty = fallback to semantic similarity

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Prediction Accuracy Too Low
**Mitigation:** Start with simple patterns (bigrams), expand if successful

### Risk 2: Resource Overhead
**Mitigation:** Limit preloading (max 100 episodes), monitor memory usage

### Risk 3: Privacy Concerns
**Mitigation:** Patterns stay local (never leave NEXUS), user controls prediction

### Risk 4: Overfitting to Past Behavior
**Mitigation:** Pattern decay (recent = higher weight), real-time adaptation

**Status:** Research complete, moving to design phase

**Next Step:** Design pattern learning algorithms and prediction engine architecture
