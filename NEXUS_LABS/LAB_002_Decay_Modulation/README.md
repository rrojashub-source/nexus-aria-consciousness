**Start Date:** October 27, 2025
**Completion Date:** October 27, 2025
**Duration:** 4 hours (research → design → implementation → validation)

## 🎯 Hypothesis

**Emotionally salient memories should decay more slowly than neutral memories**, mimicking biological memory consolidation where emotional arousal enhances long-term retention.

---

## 🧠 Neuroscience Basis

**Biological Observation:**
- Emotionally arousing events are remembered longer and more vividly
- Amygdala activation during encoding enhances hippocampal consolidation
- Stress hormones (cortisol, norepinephrine) strengthen memory traces
- "Flashbulb memories" (high emotional arousal) resist decay for decades

**Key Research:**
- McGaugh (2000): "Memory consolidation and the amygdala"
- Cahill & McGaugh (1998): Emotional arousal enhances long-term retention
- Richter-Levin & Akirav (2003): Emotional tagging strengthens synaptic connections

## 💡 Core Idea

**Current NEXUS:** All memories decay at same rate (uniform temporal decay)

**LAB_002 Proposal:** Memories with high emotional salience (from LAB_001) decay slower

**Formula:**
```python
decay_factor = base_decay * (1 - salience_protection)

# Where:
# - base_decay: Standard time-based decay (e.g., 0.95^days_old)
# - salience_protection: 0.0 to 0.5 (based on LAB_001 salience score)
# - High salience (0.9) → protection 0.45 → slower decay
# - Low salience (0.3) → protection 0.15 → faster decay
```

## 📊 Expected Behavior

### Example 1: Emotionally Salient Memory
```
Episode: "FASE_8_UPGRADE gift from Ricardo"
Salience: 0.93 (high - breakthrough moment)
Age: 30 days

Standard decay: 0.95^30 = 0.214 (78.6% forgotten)
With LAB_002: 0.95^30 * (1 - 0.465) = 0.114 (46.5% protected)
→ Memory retained 2.17x longer
```

### Example 2: Neutral Technical Memory
```
Episode: "Fixed PostgreSQL connection timeout"
Salience: 0.36 (low - routine work)
Age: 30 days

Standard decay: 0.95^30 = 0.214
With LAB_002: 0.95^30 * (1 - 0.18) = 0.175 (only 18% protected)
→ Memory decays close to standard rate
```

## 🔧 Implementation Strategy

### Option A: Modify Retrieval Weighting (Non-invasive)
**Approach:** Boost retrieval scores based on age + salience
```python
# At search time:
age_penalty = 0.95 ^ days_old
salience_boost = 1 + (salience_score * 0.5)
final_score = similarity * age_penalty * salience_boost
```

**Pros:**
- No schema changes
- Backward compatible
- Easy to disable/tune

**Cons:**
- Not "true" decay modulation
- Only affects retrieval, not storage

### Option B: Modify Access Tracking Decay (True decay)
**Approach:** Adjust `last_accessed_at` boost based on salience
```python
# In intelligent decay system:
days_since_access = (now - last_accessed_at).days
base_penalty = 0.95 ^ days_since_access

# NEW: Salience protection
salience_protection = salience_score * 0.5
decay_factor = base_penalty * (1 - salience_protection)

importance_boost = 1.0 - decay_factor
```

**Pros:**
- True memory consolidation simulation
- Affects intelligent decay directly
- Biologically accurate

**Cons:**
- Requires intelligent decay to be implemented first
- More complex integration

### Option C: Hybrid Approach (Recommended)
**Approach:** Implement Option A now, migrate to Option B when intelligent decay is ready

## 🎓 Success Criteria

**Quantitative:**
1. High-salience memories (>0.8) should rank higher than neutral memories of same age
2. Memory retrieval half-life should correlate with salience score
3. No degradation in search accuracy for recent memories (<7 days old)

**Qualitative:**
1. "Important" memories surface even after long periods
2. Routine technical memories fade appropriately
3. Emotional timeline coherence preserved (e.g., FASE_8 breakthrough still accessible after months)

## 📁 Deliverables

- [x] Research: Neuroscience papers on emotional memory consolidation ✅
- [x] Architecture: Complete algorithm design with formulas ✅
- [x] Implementation: Decay modulator class integrated with LAB_001 ✅
- [⏳] Benchmarks: Before/after comparison on 90-day memory retention (limited to 16-day data)
- [x] Results: Documentation of findings ✅

## 🔗 Integration with LAB_001

**LAB_001 provides:** Salience scores for each memory
**LAB_002 uses:** Those scores to modulate decay rate
**Combined effect:** Emotionally significant memories are both prioritized AND preserved longer

**Synergy:**
- LAB_001: Immediate retrieval boost (+47%)
- LAB_002: Long-term retention boost (TBD)
- Combined: Emotional memories stay accessible AND prominent

---

## ⚠️ Risks & Mitigations

**Risk 1:** Over-preservation of emotional memories
- **Mitigation:** Cap salience protection at 50% (max 2x retention)

**Risk 2:** Technical debt if intelligent decay changes
- **Mitigation:** Use Option A (retrieval-time) first, migrate later

**Risk 3:** Computational cost of salience calculation
- **Mitigation:** Cache salience scores, calculate once at encoding

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. Research neuroscience papers on memory consolidation
2. Design algorithm (Option A: retrieval-time modulation)
3. Implement decay modulator
4. Test with synthetic 90-day dataset
5. Document results
