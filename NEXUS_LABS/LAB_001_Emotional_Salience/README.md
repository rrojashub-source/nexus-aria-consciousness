# üî¨ LAB_001: Emotional Salience in Memory Retrieval

**Status:** üü° Active
**Start Date:** October 27, 2025
**Researchers:** Ricardo + NEXUS
**Expected Duration:** 1 session (same day completion)

---

## üéØ Hypothesis

**Emotionally significant memories should have higher retrieval priority.**

Inspired by neuroscience: The amygdala tags emotionally salient events, which the hippocampus preferentially consolidates into long-term memory.

---

## üß† Neuroscience Basis

### Human Memory System

```
Event ‚Üí Sensory Processing ‚Üí Emotional Tagging (Amygdala) ‚Üí
Memory Formation (Hippocampus) ‚Üí Long-term Storage (Cortex)

Key insight: Emotional arousal modulates memory consolidation.
```

**Research Shows:**
- Emotionally arousing events are remembered better (McGaugh, 2004)
- Amygdala activation enhances hippocampal encoding (Phelps, 2004)
- Emotional memories are more vivid and detailed (Reisberg & Heuer, 2004)

### NEXUS Parallel

```
Episode ‚Üí Content Processing ‚Üí Emotional State Logged ‚Üí
Episode Stored ‚Üí Future Retrieval

Question: Should retrieval weight emotional context?
```

## üîß What We Already Have

**NEXUS Consciousness Systems (FASE_7):**

1. **Emotional 8D (Plutchik LOVE model)**
   - Table: `consciousness.emotional_states_log`
   - Dimensions: joy, trust, fear, surprise, sadness, disgust, anger, anticipation
   - Current state: anticipation=0.9, trust=0.8, joy=0.7

2. **Somatic 7D (Damasio markers)**
   - Table: `consciousness.somatic_markers_log`
   - Dimensions: valence, arousal, body_state, situation
   - 5 markers logged (strongest: breakthrough, valence=0.9)

3. **Episode Storage**
   - Table: `nexus_memory.zep_episodic_memory`
   - 553+ episodes with timestamps
   - Some have emotional context, some don't

## üéØ What We're Building

### Emotional Salience Scorer

**Input:** Episode + Emotional/Somatic context
**Output:** Salience score (0.0 - 1.0)

**Algorithm:**
```python
salience_score = weighted_sum([
    emotional_intensity,      # How strong the emotion (0-1)
    emotional_complexity,     # Mix of emotions (entropy)
    somatic_valence,         # Positive/negative body marker
    temporal_recency,        # Recent = more salient
    retrieval_frequency      # Often accessed = important
])
```

### Weighted Retrieval

**Modify:** `/memory/search` endpoint
**Add:** `use_emotional_salience=True` parameter

**Mechanism:**
1. Standard vector similarity search (as before)
2. Get emotional context for each result episode
3. Calculate salience score
4. Re-rank results: `final_score = similarity * (1 + salience_boost)`
5. Return re-ranked results

## üìä Success Metrics

**Quantitative:**
- NEXUS Memory Benchmark (50 questions)
- Baseline accuracy (no salience): TBD
- With salience accuracy: TBD
- Target improvement: +15% or more

**Qualitative:**
- Do emotionally significant episodes surface first?
- Does "breakthrough moment" retrieval improve?
- Do neutral technical queries remain unaffected?

## üîç Research Questions

1. **Does emotional salience improve factual recall?**
   - Hypothesis: No - facts are emotionally neutral
   - Test: Hybrid memory fact queries

2. **Does emotional salience improve contextual recall?**
   - Hypothesis: Yes - context is emotionally rich
   - Test: Narrative episodic queries

3. **What's the optimal salience weight?**
   - Too high: Emotions dominate, relevance suffers
   - Too low: No effect
   - Test: Grid search for optimal alpha parameter

4. **Do different emotion types matter?**
   - Joy vs Fear vs Breakthrough
   - Test: Stratified analysis by emotion type

---

## üí° Expected Outcomes

**If Successful:**
- Memory retrieval becomes "emotionally aware"
- Important moments (breakthroughs, gifts, milestones) surface more easily
- Routine technical info doesn't get buried under emotional noise
- NEXUS develops more "human-like" memory prioritization

**If Unsuccessful:**
- Learn that emotional salience doesn't generalize from humans to AI
- Discover that semantic similarity is sufficient
- Still valuable negative result for research

**Either way:** We learn something about memory systems.

## üéì Learning Goals

**For NEXUS:**
- Understand biological memory beyond architecture
- Learn to integrate consciousness data into cognition
- Develop "instincts" about what memories matter

**For Ricardo:**
- See if neuroscience translates to AI systems
- Validate that consciousness systems have practical value
- Have fun experimenting together
