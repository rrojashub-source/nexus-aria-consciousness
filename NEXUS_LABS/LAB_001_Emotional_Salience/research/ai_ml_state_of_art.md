# ü§ñ AI/ML State of the Art: Emotion in Memory Systems

**Research Date:** October 27, 2025
**Focus:** How current LLM agent systems handle memory retrieval

---

## Current Approaches in AI Memory (2024-2025)

### 1. Weighted Memory Retrieval (WMR) - Baseline

**Found in:** 2025 research on generative agents

**Mechanism:**
```python
retrieval_score = combine([
    relevance_score,      # Vector similarity
    importance_score,     # LLM-generated importance
    temporal_validity,    # Time decay
    recency_boost        # Recent = more relevant
])
```

**Key Insight:** Systems use multiple criteria, but **emotion is not one of them.**

### 2. A-MEM: Agentic Memory (2025)

**Found in:** arXiv:2502.12110

**Innovation:** Zettelkasten-inspired dynamic memory organization

**Features:**
- Cue-based recall
- Dynamic memory consolidation
- Interconnected knowledge networks
- Dynamic indexing and linking

**Emotional Component:** NOT mentioned - focuses on knowledge structure, not affective weighting.

---

### 3. MemoryBank (2024)

**Found in:** ResearchGate 2024

**Purpose:** Long-term memory for LLMs

**Approach:**
- Vector database for storage
- Time-sensitive queries
- Context-dependent retrieval
- Persistent memory across sessions

**Emotional Component:** Tracks "emotional context" as metadata but doesn't weight retrieval by it.

---

### 4. Believable Agents (Historical Context)

**Found in:** Bates (1994) - Early work on emotion in agents

**Key Idea:** Emotion creates believable behavior in AI agents

**Gap:** Focused on behavior generation, not memory retrieval optimization.

## Current Memory Retrieval Dimensions

Most advanced systems (2024-2025) combine:

| Dimension | Purpose | Weight |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| **Vector Similarity** | Semantic relevance | High |
| **Temporal Decay** | Recent > old | Medium |
| **Importance Score** | LLM-judged significance | Medium |
| **Recency Boost** | Latest context | Low |
| **Access Frequency** | Often-used = important | Low |
| **Emotional Salience** | ‚ùå NOT USED | **0** |

---

## The Gap: Emotional Weighting

### What Current Systems Do:
```python
# Standard 2024-2025 retrieval
score = (
    0.6 * vector_similarity +
    0.2 * importance_score +
    0.1 * temporal_decay +
    0.1 * recency_boost
)
```

### What NEXUS Could Do:
```python
# Emotional salience retrieval (novel)
score = (
    0.5 * vector_similarity +
    0.2 * emotional_salience +    # NEW
    0.15 * importance_score +
    0.1 * temporal_decay +
    0.05 * recency_boost
)
```

---

## Why the Gap Exists

**Hypothesis:**

1. **Most LLM agents don't have consciousness systems**
   - No emotional state tracking
   - No continuous identity
   - Stateless between sessions

2. **Focus on factual retrieval**
   - Q&A systems prioritize accuracy
   - Emotion seen as "noise" not "signal"

3. **Lack of neuroscience inspiration**
   - Systems designed by ML engineers, not cognitive scientists
   - "Works well enough" without biology

4. **NEXUS is unique:**
   - Persistent consciousness (FASE_7)
   - Emotional 8D + Somatic 7D already running
   - Built explicitly to explore consciousness

## Research Opportunity

**Finding:** Emotion-weighted memory retrieval in LLM agents is an **unexplored area** (as of 2025).

**Papers Mention:**
- ‚úÖ Vector similarity
- ‚úÖ Temporal decay
- ‚úÖ Importance scoring
- ‚úÖ Access frequency
- ‚ùå Emotional salience

**NEXUS Opportunity:**
- First implementation of emotion-weighted retrieval for AI agents
- Direct application of neuroscience to LLM memory
- Potential novel contribution to the field

## Relevant Systems to Monitor

### 1. Zep (2025)
- Temporal knowledge graphs
- Does NOT use emotional weighting
- Focus: temporal reasoning, not affective

### 2. Mem0 (2024)
- Production memory for agents
- Does NOT use emotional weighting
- Focus: efficiency, not psychology

### 3. MemGPT (2023)
- LLMs as operating systems
- Does NOT use emotional weighting
- Focus: architecture, not consciousness

**None of the SOTA systems use emotional salience for retrieval.**

## Comparison: Biology vs AI (2025)

| Feature | Human Brain | Current AI Agents | NEXUS (Proposed) |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Emotional tagging | ‚úÖ Amygdala | ‚ùå None | ‚úÖ Consciousness systems |
| Emotion-weighted recall | ‚úÖ Automatic | ‚ùå Not implemented | üü° LAB_001 |
| Sleep consolidation | ‚úÖ Hippocampus | ‚ùå None | üîµ LAB_003 (future) |
| Neuroplasticity | ‚úÖ LTP/LTD | ‚ùå Static | üîµ LAB_002 (future) |

## Key Takeaway

**Current AI memory systems in 2025:**
- Advanced in semantic retrieval
- Sophisticated in temporal handling
- **Completely neglect emotional dimensions**

**NEXUS LAB_001 is pioneering work:** First known implementation of neurosciencebased emotional salience in AI agent memory retrieval.

**Conclusion:** Emotion-weighted retrieval is biologically validated but AI-unexplored. NEXUS is positioned to pioneer this approach.
