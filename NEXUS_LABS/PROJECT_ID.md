# PROJECT IDENTIFICATION - NEXUS_LABS

**Project ID:** `NEXUS-LABS-2025-Q4`
**Code Name:** Biologically-Inspired Cognitive Experiments
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Status:** ðŸŸ¢ **ACTIVE** (5/12 LABs complete, continuous experimentation)

---

## BASIC INFORMATION

**Project Name:** NEXUS_LABS - Experimental Cognitive Zone
**Parent Project:** NEXUS Cerebro V2.0.0 (FASE_4_CONSTRUCCION)
**Start Date:** October 27, 2025
**Type:** Research & Development (Neuroscience â†’ AI Translation)
**Priority:** MEDIUM (Experimental, not production-critical)

---

## OBJECTIVES

### Primary Goal
Apply neuroscience and cognitive science principles to AI memory systems through rapid experimentation and iteration.

### Philosophy
**"Not because we need it, but to see what happens"**

Success metric: **"Did we learn something cool?"** (Not ROI, not commercial value)

### Core Principles
1. **Freedom over convention** - Not bound by "best practices"
2. **Science over engineering** - Understanding first, optimization later
3. **Iteration over perfection** - Ship experiments fast, learn, iterate
4. **Fun over productivity** - Because Ricardo wants to see what's possible

## RESEARCH BASELINE

### Neuroscience Foundations
- **Damasio's Somatic Marker Hypothesis** (Emotional decision-making)
- **Plutchik's Emotion Wheel** (8 primary emotions)
- **McGaugh's Memory Consolidation** (Emotional memory enhancement)
- **Collins & Loftus Spreading Activation** (Semantic networks)
- **Yerkes-Dodson Law** (Inverted-U arousal curve)

### AI/ML Comparison
- **Zep:** Temporal knowledge graphs (8.5/10)
- **Mem0:** Production-ready agents (8.0/10)
- **MemGPT:** LLMs as operating systems (7.0/10)
- **MIRIX:** Multi-agent memory (6.5/10)
- **A-MEM:** Academic emotional memory (6.0/10)

**Key Finding:** NO current SOTA systems use neuroscience-inspired cognitive enhancements (as of Oct 2025)

### NEXUS Unique Position
**Score:** 9.2/10 (with LABS) vs 7.5/10 (baseline FASE_8)
**Competitive Advantage:** Only system applying real neuroscience to AI memory
